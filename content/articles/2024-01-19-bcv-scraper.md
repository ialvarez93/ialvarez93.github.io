## Situation

Venezuela's e-commerce sector is expected to grow due to increasing Internet penetration, development of the legal framework, and improved capabilities of banks to provide secure transactions [^1]. After the pandemic business boomed, it's required by law to have a bill in the national currency (Bs.) but most products and transactions are advertised in USD. let's see two examples:

**Librería La Alegría** is a bookstore and stationery store that offers over 15,000 products related to office supplies, school items, art supplies, technical and school books, games, and more. The store also provides a cultural center for the city with workshops for children and events[^2].

It's tech stack is an Odoo instance. There's no mobile app. The billing is done directly in a store.  A [quick search](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?search=BCV) indicates that there are 3 extension and on of them is free. But it might not be open source, I couldn't find the repo.

**Tu Zona Market** is an online marketplace that connects local vendors with customers. The platform offers a range of products, including groceries, electronics, and home appliances, and provides customers with a seamless shopping experience in two states [^3].

Uses Angular what looks like express backend, I can't really be sure. So they needed two things for getting the:

1. A web scraper: a program that extracts data from a website by parsing its HTML code.
2. RESTful APIs with minimal code and high performance.
3. Database Storage for historical data (for returns, refunds and the like).

We are going to address the first 2.

## Solution

A simple web scraper built in Python with FastAPI can be useful for a software developer who wants to access and analyze the financial data from the official website of Banco Central de Venezuela.

By using a web scraper built in Python with FastAPI, you can:

- Automate the process of fetching the latest exchange rates, from the website of Banco Central de Venezuela.
- Convert the scraped data into JSON format, which can be stored, transmitted, and processed by various applications and tools.
- Create a custom API that exposes the scraped data as endpoints, which can be accessed by other developers or users who need the data for their own purposes.
- Apply data analysis, visualization, or machine learning techniques to the scraped data, using the rich set of libraries and packages available in Python.

A made a base public in ths repo.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
