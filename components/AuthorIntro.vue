      As a junior full stack software engineer, I enjoy developing scalable web applications that can adapt to changing
      customer needs and market trends. I have hands-on experience in building composable commerce solutions, using
      various technologies in the PHP ecosystem to create customized and flexible E-commerce platforms.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I enjoy working in a collaborative and agile
      environment. I'm looking for opportunities to apply my skills and experience to create impactful and user-friendly
      solutions.

      I am also a curious and avid reader, movie goer and Japanophile. I like to explore different cultures and
      perspectives, and I'm always open to new challenges.
