      As a junior full stack software engineer, I enjoy developing scalable web applications that can adapt to changing
      customer needs and market trends. I have hands-on experience in building composable commerce solutions, using
      various technologies in the PHP ecosystem to create customized and flexible E-commerce platforms.

      I am also a curious and avid reader, movie goer and Japanophile who likes to keep up with the latest trends and
      developments in data engineering and related fields. I like to explore different cultures and
      perspectives, and I'm always open to new challenges.
